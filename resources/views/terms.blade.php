                        <p>This document defines the terms and conditions of our working relationship. All projects or
                            services that CLOUDHOST® (hereafter referred to as “CLOUDHOST” or “we”) may be contracted to

                        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                        <p>
                            You must agree to the below terms of service before you can create your CLOUDHOST Web
                            Hosting account.
                            Our website will not permit you to make any Order unless you agree to the below terms of
                            service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our terms of service (TOS) are designed to provided to our customers a clear and transparent
                            understanding of what we expect of them while they are using our service(s).
                            The use of CLOUDHOST service(s) represents your acceptance and agreement to
                            CLOUDHOST’s (TOS), regardless of whether you have read them or not
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We accept your use of our service(s); therefore we do not actively monitor your accounts
                            activity under normal conditions. Furthermore, we do not implement editorial control over
                            the content of any Web site. This includes e-mail sending, news group or other material
                            created or available over or through the services, except for certain proprietary Web sites.
                            However, in accordance with our (TOS), we hold full authority to remove any materials that,
                            in our individual judgment, may be illegal, may subject us to liability or which may violate
                            our (TOS). CLOUDHOST reserves the right to oblige with legal establishment and/or third
                            parties in the examination of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrongdoing.
                            Violation of our (TOS) may result in the suspension or immediate termination of your
                            CLOUDHOST Hosting account and/or services.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We do not routinely monitor the activity of accounts except for measurements of system
                            exploitation, possible security or fraud risks and the preparation of billing records.
                            However, in our efforts to promote good citizenship within the Internet society, we will
                            respond appropriately if we become aware of improper use of our service.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If a CLOUDHOST Web Hosting account is used to violate our (TOS) we reserve the right to
                            cease your service without notice.
                            We prefer to advise customers of inapt activities and any necessary corrective action.
                            However, blatant violations of the (TOS) will result in instantaneous termination of
                            service.
                            Our failure to implement this policy, for whatever reason, shall not be interpreted as a
                            waiver of our right to do so at any time.
                        </p>
